# UberSuggest-extractor
This Python code lets you to extract data from several csv in one. 
I programmed it in order to be used with UberSuggest. If you want to use with other providers, you need to edit it or just wait until I publish the next version.
These data will be filtered without duplicates.

HOW TO USE:
Create a folder and paste the Extractor.py
Create a folder for each sets of files you want to analyze
Do not add other files in the main directory
Each folder has to have 3 files and each one has to be partially named as (wild card present):
 -backlinks.csv
 -Top_pages_
 -ubersuggest_
 

Once clicked, write y then enter and the program will do its magic.
